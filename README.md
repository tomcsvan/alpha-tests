# ML Core

Cofounder led machine learning development and experimentation for internal systems. This repository serves as an R&D workspace for prototyping models and infrastructure that may support future production use.

## Purpose

This repo is intended for exploratory work in machine learning architecture, model design, and evaluation workflows. Components are iteratively developed with long-term system integration in mind.

## Highlights

- Experimental pipelines for supervised learning
- Modular model evaluation and tracking
- Reproducible development workflow
- Research-driven architecture, adaptable to evolving use cases
